## My First Power Query/Power BI Project! ##

## Introduction
There are **so many** amazing and powerful data analysis/BI tools out there! Power BI is definitely among the **top choices**, and itâ€™s one Iâ€™ve wanted to learn for a long time. Finally, inspired by yet another YouTube tutorial, I created this end-to-end data analysis project, providing insights into various projects and their details.

## Overview
This project is a **simple Power BI dashboard** designed to help analyze **department budgets and project costs**. The goal is to identify which departments or projects might be **over budget** or **underperforming** and to check if a **one-year budget** could cover all expenses instead of two years.
All the data comes from Absent Data data analytics course (https://absentdata.com/data-analysis/data-analysis-end-to-end-project/). This tutorial includes building SQL database, but I decided to do this project entirely in Power Query and Power BI. Some of the source csv files can be found it the "project files" folder. 

## Data Processing
- **Data Loaded from CSV Files** and cleaned in **Power Query**.
- **Merged Tables** to include department, project, and employee details.
- **Calculated Budget Utilization Ratios** to compare costs vs. budget.
- **Basic Conditional Formatting** to highlight underused budgets.

## Dashboard Features
âœ” **Employee Details Side Pane** â€“ Displays employee role, salary and current projects, photo included for easy identification. 

âœ” **Department Budget Overview** â€“ Shows budget, expenses, and utilization.

âœ” **Project Status & Costs** â€“ Overview of completed and ongoing projects and their budgets.

âœ” **Simple Conditional Formatting** â€“ Red for low budget usage, green for efficient use.

âœ” **Basic Interactivity** â€“ Clickable elements for filtering.

## Findings
- Most departments have **low budget utilization**.
- **All costs could be covered in one year**, meaning resources might be reallocated.

## Future Improvements
- If more data were available, I think these might be some interesting improvements:
  - Add **trend analysis** to track spending over time 
  - Include **forecasting for budget planning** 
  - Gather more **performance metrics** for better insights

This project is a learning experience in **Power BI and data visualization**. Suggestions for improvement are always welcome! ðŸ˜Š
